The website is easy to navigate and has a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes. The website has a header that contains your name and a navigation menu that links to different sections of the website. The website has a hero section that displays a background image and a call-to-action button that links to your work. The website has a projects section that displays your work in a grid layout. Each project has a title, description, and image. The website has a contact section that contains a contact form and your social media links.

Overall, your portfolio website is a great way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. It’s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. In addition, it’s one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities. Having your own website means clients are always able to find you and if interested, reach out for you. If you don’t have an online presence nowadays, you are behind the times.
